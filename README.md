Repo to practice basic VCS management

Hello Marcus, I'm practicing basic git mechanics

That was a huge failure so I'm going to try editing this file again before sending a pull request

I'm going to just keep doing this until I get the hang of it. I also have questions.

**Question 1**
What is the difference between "git add . {I am editing something in the middle of the page}" and "git commit -a" <---this one keeps sending me to vim

**Question 2**
Do I have to push every commit? OR can I keep committing {<text deleted> and then committing. Blah blah blah} things and then push them at the end of the day? I guess not because they might conflict? Let me try it I guess.

I think this line might break something

Ok well it didn't break anything. Now I'm going to go edit something at the top of the page and see if that breaks it.

Trying this again but I'm going to change something in the middle of the page and commit it and then change it back and commit it and THEN push.
