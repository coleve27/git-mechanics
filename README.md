Repo to practice basic VCS management

Hello Marcus, I'm practicing basic git mechanics

That was a huge failure so I'm going to try editing this file again before sending a pull request

I'm going to just keep doing this until I get the hang of it. I also have questions.

**Question 1**
What is the difference between "git add . " and "git commit -a" <---this one keeps sending me to vim

**Question 2**
Do I have to push every commit? OR can I keep committing things and then push them at the end of the day? I guess not because they might conflict? Let me try it I guess.

I think this line might break something
